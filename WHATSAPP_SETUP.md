2. Create a new app and select "Business" as the app type
3. Add WhatsApp product to your app

- **Phone Number ID**: The ID of your WhatsApp Business phone number
- **Business Account ID**: Your WhatsApp Business Account ID
- **Webhook Verify Token**: A custom token for webhook verification

### 3. Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```env

### 4. Webhook Configuration

1. Set up a webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/whatsapp/webhook`
2. Use the verify token: `safai_sathi_verify_token`
3. Subscribe to `messages` events

### 5. Phone Number Format

Ensure staff phone numbers are stored in the correct format:
- Include country code (e.g., +91 for India)
- Remove spaces, dashes, and parentheses

## Features

## Testing

### Test Notification
You can test the WhatsApp integration by:

1. Using the API endpoint to send a test message
2. Assigning work to a staff member through the dashboard
3. Updating work status to completed

### Test Webhook
1. Use the webhook URL with the verify token
2. Send test messages to your WhatsApp Business number
3. Check the console logs for incoming message processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Phone Number Format**
   - Ensure phone numbers include country code
   - Remove special characters

2. **Access Token Issues**
   - Verify the access token is valid and not expired
   - Check if the token has the required permissions

3. **Webhook Verification Failed**
   - Ensure the verify token matches in both places
   - Check the webhook URL is accessible

4. **Message Not Delivered**
   - Verify the phone number is registered on WhatsApp
   - Check if the recipient has blocked your business number

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by checking the browser console and server logs for detailed error messages.

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive credentials to version control
2. **Webhook Security**: Implement proper authentication for webhook endpoints
3. **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of WhatsApp API rate limits
4. **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
